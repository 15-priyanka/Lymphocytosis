<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Lymphocytosis itself does not cause symptoms. However, you may experience symptoms from the underlying cause of lymphocytosis. Depending on the cause, symptoms may range from no symptoms to severe.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="third"> CAUSES:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Lymphocytosis results from increased numbers of lymphocytes in your blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. They play an important role in your immune system, helping your body fight off infection. Many underlying medical conditions can cause lymphocytosis.</li><li>
High lymphocyte blood levels indicate your body is dealing with an infection or other inflammatory condition. Most often, a temporarily high lymphocyte count is a normal effect of your bodyâ€™s immune system working. Sometimes, lymphocyte levels are elevated because of a serious condition, like leukemia.
